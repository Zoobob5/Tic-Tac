Creating Variables

This step suggests initializing the variables your program will need. For your Tic-Tac-Toe game, these variables might include:

    The game board (a 3x3 grid).
    The current player (to track whose turn it is).
    Player names (to store the names of player 1 and player 2).

Text Prompts

Text prompts help users understand what the program is doing and what inputs are required. These prompts guide the user through the interaction with your program.

In your Tic-Tac-Toe game, you might need prompts for:

    Entering player names.
    Instructions on how to play (e.g., how to make a move).
    Notifications of whose turn it is.
    Announcements for winners or ties.

Run the Program Frequently

Running the program every few lines of code helps identify and fix bugs early. This iterative approach allows you to test small parts of your program, ensuring each part works correctly before moving on to the next.
Applying These Steps to Your Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Here's a step-by-step guide to apply these principles:

    Initialize Variables:
        Create a class to encapsulate the game logic.
        Define instance variables for the game board, current player, and player names.

    Add Text Prompts:
        Use input to get player names.
        Use Tkinter to display whose turn it is and other game information.

    Iteratively Develop and Test:
        Start by setting up the game window and grid.
        Add functionality for handling player moves.
        Implement win/tie checking logic.
        Add prompts and messages for players.
